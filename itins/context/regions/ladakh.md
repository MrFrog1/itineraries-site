Ladakhi Culture - from The Indus River Camp Brochure

a) Religion - Buddhism and Islam are the two dominant religions of Ladakh – the district of Leh is 66 % Buddhist and the Kargil district to the west has an Islamic majority. There is also a Ladakhi community of Moravian Christians, mostly in Shey and Leh. Hindus, Sikhs have generally settled in Ladakh in recent history, as tradesmen, businessmen, government workers and labourers.

Until the 15th century, Buddhism was unchallenged throughout Ladakh. Muslim settlers appeared on occasion, but it wasn’t until the start of the 17th century, when King Jamyang Namgyal was captured during his invasion of Baltistan (Now Turtuk and the border region of Pakistan). In captivity, the King married a Balti princess, Gyal Khatoon. Her dowry brought with her to Ladakh a retinue of craftsmen, polo players and musicians who settled in our village, Chuchot. The annual polo tournament in July is a legacy of this centuries old migration. In Ladakh, Buddhists are split between Red Hat and Yellow Hat sects of the religion.

b) Environment - Ladakh exists amidst a delicate balance. The winters are very cold, bringing in snow that settles. This melts through the summer, giving life to the valleys, from streams. As a desert, water is scarce and valuable. As you fly into Ladakh, the presence of water is immediately noticeable - anywhere you see greenery, amidst the sand and mountains.

And yet, the climate is changing fast in Ladakh. Temperatures are rising, there’s less snow and more rain. The trouble with the rain is that it quickly overwhelms the local environment. The terrain here is so barren that there’s nothing to hold the water down – it rolls down the hills, not settling and putting the villages on hillsides at risk.

The change in environment has unexpected effects – the increase in rain has changed building styles, with sloped rooves now considered instead of the traditional flat roof. Similarly, mud bricks are being shunned by some for cement bricks. Some mud bricks are stabilised with 8% cement, in order to give it more strength against water.

c) Architecture - Ladakh has winters of -30 Celsius and hot summers, so we build our homes for the extreme cold and the desert sun that it receives. The science behind this is called passive solar heating – using the energy of the sun to regulate the temperature inside. The best method is to use the low angle of the sun in the winter, so that sunlight heats up the thermal mass inside . In the summer, the sun is higher and deflects from the roof. You will often see glass walls onto a black surface outside of home, known as Trombe walls, that magnify the solar heat in the winter.

Historically, construction was done with local materials. Mud from our village, which has a high clay content, is shaped into bricks and left to dry in the sun. Poplars provide the primary beams for the ceiling and the branches of the willow are placed on top. In the village walk, you will see labourers making the bricks and the poplars and willows grown in each garden.

In monasteries, they used rammed earth to make a stronger build. Nowadays, cement bricks are becoming more popular, especially with the increase in rain, and concrete pillars and plinths provide much needed stability to buildings.

d) History - Rock carvings suggest Ladakh has been inhabited since the neolithic period in 9000 BC, but skipping forward to AD, Ladakh was often at the mercy of the ambitions of Tibetan, Mughal, Mongol and Central Asian powers.

In 842, a representative of the ancient Tibetan royal house founded the first Ladakhi dynasty. This was the Tibetanisation of Ladakh, yet it imported its strain of Buddhism from Kashmir. From the 13th century, it looked back to Tibet again for guidance on Buddhism. Ladakh was defeated by the Balti ruler Ali Sher Khan Anchan in the 17th century, which laid the path for the modern demographic.

After India attained Independence, Jammu and Kashmir initially remained an independent state. On 22 October, 1947, when militias attacked, backed by Pakistan, the King of Jammu and Kashmir sought assistance from India and signed the Instrument of Accession, that would make Jammu and Kashmir a part of the Indian Federation. From that point onwards, Ladakh, was part of Jammu and Kashmir, until Ladakh was declared independent of Kashmir in 2019 and became a Union Territory, after decades of campaigning for more autonomy.

e) Art and Artisans - The earliest examples of artistic expression in Ladakh are in some 150 documented sites of petroglyphs across Ladakh. (See this website for more details - https://www.sahapedia.org/petroglyphs-ladakh).

For those interested in Buddhist art, there are beautiful, well-preserved murals in Gotsang, Saspol and Basgo, but none are as impressive as those in Alchi. These were painted almost a millennium ago and are from the period before Tibetan Buddhism came, so the colours are raw and earthy, unlike the Tibetan style which are bright yellows, reds, golds and blues.

Ladakh is famous for the pashmina from its goat. Living in such a cold, dry climate, it produces the finest pashmina wool in the world. Local artisans and weavers create traditional and modern designs with pashmina, yak and sheep wool.

Elsewhere in Ladakh, there’s the family in Likir making traditional pottery. In Chilling, there are old copper artisans and in Turtuk is a stone artist, who makes stone Ibexes and mini pressure cookers, with an extraordinary level of skill.

The Islamic culture lives on through craft, polo, archery and music.

f) Cuisine -

Traditionally, Ladakhis had little access to vegetables and spices. Therefore, much of Ladakhi cuisine revolves around barley, butter and wheat, whilst the nomadic population were more likely to live off dried and frozen meats – yak and mutton.

Notable dishes are Thukpa (a noodle soup), Chutagi (a wheat-based pasta) Skyu (like Chutagi, but with a bit of soup and vegetables), Mok Moks (known as Momos elsewhere), Khambir (a fermented bread). Chhang is a local, mild alcohol brewed from barley that is widely drunk at wedding celebrations.

With the change in growing and with access to ingredients that werent possible, the food that Ladakhis eat is changing rapidly – world and Indian cuisine are very popular and innovative local chefs are experimenting with traditional recipes, using ingredients that werent previously available.

Some examples of such restaurants are Dolkhar (vegetarian only), Namza (highly recommended), whilst De Khambir in Leh offers more traditional fare.

Logistics of Travelling to Ladakh (from The Indus River Camp website)

COMMUNICATION
​
​

Be aware that all foreign mobile phones will have no reception in Ladakh and that, of the Indian networks, Airtel, Jio and BSNL are the only three that are compatible at the time of writing. Of those networks, only postpaid sims work - prepaid sim cards of these providers do not work. We do have wi-fi at the property

SAFETY

​

Ladakh is known for being a peaceful place with an interfaith society that lives and works together in harmony.

In urban areas, you must be wary of dogs at night. They are extremely territorial and form gangs to survive the hard winters.

​

The greatest concern that you must consider is altitude. Flying to Leh from sea level means a sudden transition from 0 to 3,400 metres above sea level and your body needs to cope with that.

​

​

​

​

​

ALTITUDE

​

At 3,400 metres above sea level, Leh is as high as many peaks across the world. If you are staying at The Indus River Camp, you will be 200 metres lower which will help with acclimatisation.

​

Flying in from sea level to that altitude is a shock on the body and it needs time to adjust to the new environment. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) does not discriminate by age or health. The most frequently affected are healthy, young men who believe that their time in the gym means that they can be more active.

To enjoy your holiday altitude must not be taken lightly and you must plan a sensible itinerary that allows for acclimatisation. Typically, when flying in from sea level, the body takes two to three days to acclimatise to a level where you can be active but certain precautions are necessary to avoid AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness):

​

The first day must be reserved for relaxing and acclimatising with minimum physical exertion

Sleeping during the day is not recommended as our bodies don't adjust to the altitude as well within sleep

Alcohol should be avoided in the first two days

Stay properly hydrated

​

Diamox is an effective medicine for treating acclimatisation. It should be taken one or two days before arriving to Ladakh and continued for two or three days. Be sure to check with a doctor or pharmacist about side effects and usage.

​

If you are arriving by road via Manali or Srinagar then you will have acclimatised to a certain degree during the journey but the same precautions are necessary.

​

WEATHER

​

The weather of Ladakh is volatile yet relatively predictable with the Leh temperature following a schedule.

​

In winter Ladakh is at its coldest. December through to February, the mercury will regularly drop to -20 degrees at night and can even reach -30. Ladakh is a desert and a powerful sun makes winter days tolerable, hovering at about 1 degree.

​

Through March and April the temperature transitions into summer. Night temperatures in early March can be as cold as -10 degrees but by the end of April, nights will be just above freezing.

​

In May the temperature starts to rise and you can expect days of 15 degrees that feel hotter due to the power of the sun. Nights will be chilly but manageable and crips at around 5 degrees.

​

Through June, July and August Ladakh is much warmer with 20-30 degrees during the day and 10-15 degrees at night.

​

ENVIRONMENT

​

Ladakh was open to the public in the early 1970s and enjoyed keen and sparse tourism, mostly from abroad. In 2009 the success of Bollywood film 3 Idiots, its spectacular ending shot on Pangong Lake, introduced a domestic audience to the gem on its doorstep.

​

The population of Ladakh is small and the sudden footfall put a strain on the region's infrastructure. Tourism has become the dominant industry and environmentally the region was unprepared. There is no recycling in Ladakh and water is scarce. Ladakhis have lived with this awareness, but the tourist industry brings new demands. Plastic is commonplace and tourism is depleting water reserves in an arid desert region.

​

At the same time, the volatile effects of climate change are upsetting the balance of Ladakh's ecosystem. Ladakh depends on snowfall in the winter - it bolsters the glaciers which melt into streams that give life to farms and villages. Too much snowfall and the rivers will overflow in the summers (as seen in 2017) and not enough snowfall and the farmers will be unable to feed their crops.

​

In a region where recycling is not possible, the only option to dispose of rubbish is to dig or burn it. Plastic, no matter how convenient, needs to be limited. If you are travelling to Ladakh then we would encourage you to bring a flask that you can carry around with you. At camp and through Ladakh there is plentiful access to Himalayan spring water that is far fresher than anything contained in a plastic bottle and considerably less damaging to the local environment.

​

​

​

​

LANGUAGE

​

The native language to Ladakh is Ladakhi, a Tibetan language spoken only in Ladakh, though it is not mutually intelligible with Tibetan.

​

Many Ladakhis speak Hindi and most educated Ladakhis and those working in tourism will speak English.

​

Here are some useful words in Ladakhi. The first is the most ubiquitous, be sure to remember it.

​

- Julley (Crucial to learn! Means Hello, Goodbye, Thank you - Pronounced Joo-Lay!)

- Khamsang-Ley (Said as a question it means 'How are you?' and as an answer 'I am fine!')

- Don-ley (Means 'Eat' or 'Take' - if you experience Ladakhi hospitality then you will hear this consistently)

- Man-Ley (No, thanks)

- O-Ley (Yes, thanks)

​

PERMITS

All tourists, Indian and foreign, require Inner Line Permits to visit remote parts of Ladakh. These can be arranged through any travel agent for a charge of approximately 800 rupees for a week-long permit which they will source from the Deputy Commissioner's office. These permits will grant you access to Tsomiriri, Pangong, Nubra Valley, Dha/Hanu amongst others.

Hanle, home to the Indian Astronomical Observatory, has been restricted to foreigners but is set to open up for 2024.

TRANSPORT

​

Ladakh can only be accessed only by road or by plane. One road comes from Manali and another from Srinagar, each a lengthy trip through high-altitude roads that close for much of the year. From November until April/May you can only reach Leh by flight as the roads are blocked with heavy snow.

​

All routes are unforgettable. Flying in gives you a birds-eye view of the Himalayas. The roads are tricky and time-consuming but are a tourist attraction in themselves. The transition of scenery from the lakes and greenery of Kashmir or the green hills of Manali into the arid expanse of the Ladakhi Himalayas is unique.

​

Once you are in Ladakh you can travel via taxi, a car in your name (no rental cars), a motorbike rented within Ladakh or, for the most adventurous, a bicycle. The prices of all these modes of transport are dictated by the taxi and travel agency union.

​

​

​

UNION PRICES

​

Unions are commonplace in Ladakh. There are unions for everything from taxis to vegetable vendors and bakery shops.

This presents advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that you will not get ripped off, and the level of professionalism is very high throughout each industry. The disadvantage is that tourist expenses end up pricier than they are elsewhere in India.
​

Do not haggle with the union prices. If a taxi driver or travel agent agrees to a lesser fee then they are undermining the union and face disciplinary action. Ladakh is a remote location that depends on tourism during a season of only a few months. The prices set by the relevant unions are very reasonable when you consider this.

​

​

TAXI PRICES

​

A full list of Taxi Union prices is available on the Taxi Union website here.
The union rate list is exceedingly long covering every eventuality within Ladakh. We will publish some of the more popular prices below when the 2024 list is released.

​

​MOTORBIKE RENTAL PRICES

At the time of writing daily motorbike rental prices are as follows.

- Royal Enfield Himalaya (411cc) - 2,500

- Royal Enfield Classic (500cc) - 2,100

- Royal Enfield Standard (500cc) - 2,000

- Royal Enfield Standard (350cc) -1,100

​

FOOD​

​

The isolation of Ladakh and the extreme cold of the winter limits the availability of ingredients and types of cuisine. However, in summer many vegetables and fruits grow abundantly and those that don't are brought in from Kashmir.

​

Ladakhi food has its charm but is unlike most Indian food. A Ladakhi chef and entrepreneur started the restaurant Alchi Kitchen in Alchi which now has a branch in Leh that serves innovative Ladakhi food using fresh ingredients. Thukpa is the mainstay of Ladakhi food - a hearty noodle soup with vegetables and spice. Momos are also commonplace and delicious. At Alchi Kitchen, you will be able to try some of the lesser-known but no less delicious Ladakhi specialities such as Thenthuk, Skyu or Khambir.

​

Within Leh, all cuisines are represented. For Tibetan food check out Tibetan Kitchen, for cheap Ladakhi fare try Tashi's Restaurant by the SBI ATM in the main bazaar. Bon Appetit offers spectacular views, a homely feel, a selection of wine and European food.

Meat - mutton and chicken are the only meats widely available and on holy days and every fortnight, there are dry days where meat or alcohol must not be consumed. Fish is available in limited restaurants but eating fish is frowned upon by local Buddhist society.

​

In winter, vegetables and fruits are extremely limited as the roads close with heavy snow and the conditions are not suitable for growing in Ladakh. There will be potatoes, onions and perhaps carrots throughout these months.

​

When trekking or in remote areas expect lots of Maggi noodles.

​

FAQS

​

Can small kids go to Ladakh?

​

We advise that children unable to communicate yet do not come to Ladakh. They may feel discomfort from the altitude if they cannot express this then this could present some difficulty.

Otherwise, it should be fine, granted that you take the necessary measures mentioned above. Children's lungs often cope better with acclimatisation however they are harder to keep still and so more likely to have a problem if they are active. That said, please check with a doctor. We are not an authority.
