1. Introduction

Within the Himalayan desert of Ladakh, our property stands out as a 40- acre space of unspoilt greenery, just a 20-minute drive from the airport and city.

8 luxurious cottages sit by the river, with glass-fronted views of the Indus, Shey Palace and the surrounding mountains. One villa sits in its own private area, with its own pond, roof terrace and kitchen.

The rest of the land remains a natural space, sympathetic for wildlife and vegetation. The camp is 200 metres below Leh in altitude which, combined with the scenery, makes it the perfect base to acclimatise. The camp is owned by a society of Buddhist villagers.

There are a host of activities that we can arrange at the camp, close by and further afield.

Seasonal property - Open April 25th to October 10th

2. Chalets and Suite

These are our largest category of riverside rooms and are designed to maximise the view from within the room. A large glass front offers a view of the Indus River, Shey Palace and the Himalayan range.

Each chalet has a large veranda, a writing desk, a king-size bed with high-quality bed linen and Rajasthani quilts and eco-conscious hotel amenities. The rain shower has 24/7 hot water from solar panels .

The rooms are built primarily with sun-baked mud bricks, local wood and glass in a passive solar format with thrombe walls – a design that helps to regulate the inner temperature. We have two chalets and one chalet suite, which is the same size as the chalets, but with a larger bathroom and an additional living room with a sofa bed. The living room has views out onto the Stok Kangri mountain peak. The suite has the most private location.

3. Cottages

Our three Riverside Cottages are designed to capture as much of the surrounding view. The bedrooms look out onto the Indus River, Shey Palace and the Himalayan range.

The semi-open, yet private, showers offer a 180-degree view of the surrounding flora, with the Stok Kangri peak in the distance.

Each cottage has a large verandah, a king-size bed with high-quality bed linen and Rajasthani quilts and eco-conscious hotel amenities.

The rooms are built primarily with sun-baked mud bricks, local wood and glass.The cottages and cabins are the same rate. The cottages have a larger veranda, whilst the cabins have a slightly larger interior.

4. Cabins
   Our two Riverside Cabins are designed to capture the view, whilst prioritising privacy and warmth The bedrooms look out onto the Indus River, Shey Palace and the Himalayan range.

Each cabin verandah, a king-size bed with high-quality bed linen and Rajasthani quilts and eco-conscious hotel amenities.

As with the others, the cabins are built primarily with sun-baked mud bricks, local wood and glass.The cottages and cabins are the same rate. The cottages have a larger veranda, whilst the cabins have a slightly larger interior. The cabin has a large glass front for the views, but the bathroom is less open than the cottages, which keeps it warmer and gives an increased sense of privacy.

5. Villa

The Villa is the largest and most private accommodation that we offer, with 1,200 square feet of inside space. It has a living room, a kitchen and a huge bathroom with a bathtub looking out at the mountains.

The villa has its own private pond, popular with the local wildlife. It’s a 5-minute walk to the various riverside seating areas.

6. Kitchen

We create innovative set-menus that change daily , focusing on fresh, locally sourced ingredients, with contemporary cooking techniques. Lunch consists of 2 courses - a vegetarian main course and a dessert. Dinner is 3 courses, with a starter, a choice of vegetarian or non-vegetarian main and dessert.

We cook a range of Indian dishes and often focus on lesser-known regional recipes. An Indian main course will be made up of at least 4 dishes and will be served with rice, roti and/or papad.

We also serve continental main courses, for example pasta with freshly made sauce, garden salads or a classic chicken and mushroom pie with filo pastry. Our desserts are a mixture of traditional French treats, as well as Indian and English classics. Think fresh apricot tart, south Indian banana fritters or sticky toffee pudding.

Our breakfast a-la-carte menu has items like masala omelettes, pancakes, sourdough bread with homemade jam, aloo parathas and homemade granola with fresh fruit and curd amongst other tasty options. All served alongside a range of teas and coffee sourced within India.

​

7. Wildlife

With 40 acres of natural space, the campsite is host to a large variety of migratory birds and residential animals.

These include Himalayan Foxes, Mountain Weasels, Pika, Golden Orioles, Bluethroats, Ibisbill, Citrine Wagtails, Oriental Turtle Doves and Grey Herons, among many others. We had the first recorded sighting of a Purple Heron in Ladakh, at our pond in 2018 (opposite).We have various sets of binoculars, as well as a wildlife scope and bird books for Ladakh. If you’re interested in doing a formal tour, a local guide can take you on a morning trip around the camp and the locality for a guided birding tour.

8. Camp Activities

Within the property, we have many activities available to our guests. Each morning, we take our guests for a walk, through the local village to the local camel sanctuary. In the evening, depending on the height of the river, we go down to the riverbank for sunset.

At night, we arrange campfires under the stars and use our motorised camp to look at the moon, Saturn and its rings, Jupiter and its moon, the Andromeda Galaxy amongst others. Yet, in Ladakh, the best part is the open sky, with the milky way visible to the naked eye, which we demonstrate each night.

We have a large library and many board games, a table tennis table, a badminton net and croquet. As mentioned in the previous slide, we have facilities for birdwatching.

The above are all without charge. For a small charge, a yoga teacher does morning lessons for those who are interested, we can arrange prayers and meditation with a local monk, there’s kayaking in the river and we do lessons in making local food.

9. Local Experiences

With the camp as a base, we consult with our guests for their interests and arrange daily activities and experiences accordingly, with guides or without.
We have a separate sheet detailing the experiences and activities that are available, but these include cultural or motorbike tours, rafting on the Zanskar river, day hikes and longer treks, guided wildlife tours .

10. Tours

In collaboration with two local agencies, we organise tours throughout Ladakh according to clients’ preference of wildlife, landscape, culture and activities.

For each tour, an experienced driver takes our clients in a Toyota Innova. A guide can be arranged on request.

If you, or your client, would like a tour oriented to your interests, then get in touch.

We have detailed PDFs of sample tours to give an introductory idea of a trip to Ladakh, from which we can help to build a bespoke plan.

This is information from The Indus River Camp's Brochure. It provides relevant information to guests who are staying there, so some of the information is less relevant to those looking to book:

1. Essential Info

It is vital to rest on your first day, so your body acclimatises to the altitude. Excursions, exercise and alcohol should be avoided. If you have a severe headache or difficulty breathing, then let us know. Water and time are the best healers, but we have oxygen cylinders for emergency.
The current of the river is very strong. Combined with the cold of the snowmelt, swimming in the river must be avoided at all costs.

Taxis, bikes, rafting – all these activities have unions that set the price. Individual taxi drivers are not allowed to charge more or less than the rate list provided annually by the union. In busy times, larger taxis are in hot demand and are unwilling to do shorter journeys.

2. Essential Info

We try to minimise waste, specifically plastic. We do have toothpaste available on request, in case any guest doesn’t have any. To minimise water usage, we don’t wash towels daily but can do so on request. We clean rooms daily. If you don’t want your room cleaned, just let us know.

Our hot water is from solar panels, which is an effective, eco-friendly way to heat water in Ladakh, where we have 300 days of sun a year. We have geyser backups for the remaining 65 days. If there’s an issue with hot water or electricity, please let us know and we will resolve ASAP.

The drinking water we provide is from a bore well 150 feet below. It has been tested, it’s fresh and filtered within Himalayan rock.

Below is the view of Shey Palace from the rooms - the best light comes in the afternoon/early evening for photographing this area. Behind the rooms is the Stok Kangri peak, which, as the highest object in sight is the first to be lit by the sunrise, before the whole valley is immersed in light.

3. Meals

As a boutique property with maximum 18 guests, it would not be possible to offer a buffet or a-la-carte service, where each item was freshly prepared and cooked to the standard that we aspire.

Therefore, we create a set menu that changes daily, focussing on what is fresh in the market and our guests' dietary requirements.. We describe our kitchen as a 'home kitchen' and not a 'restaurant kitchen' and try to reduce food waste.

We kindly request that guests inform us in the morning whether they will be eating lunch and/or dinner with us and regrettably last-minute menu requests and changes are usually not possible. Do let us know if you have any preferences or dislikes.

The meal-times are as follows:
Breakfast – 7:30am to 9:30am
Lunch – 1:30pm
Dinner – 7:30pm to 9pm

We do evening snacks, listed on the following page.

   Some Info on our Pashmina Products

Pashmina is combed from the Changra goat of the Changthang region. Fibres measuring 15-19 microns are classified as ‘cashmere’ and under 15 as ‘pashmina’. The smaller the fibre, the softer and warmer the product will be. We work with pashmina when its combed until it’s made into unique, hand-made products. We are involved in every process along the way (spinning, dyeing, weaving etc) and ensure 100% traceability.

Pashmina production in Ladakh is small scale, so mountain pastures aren’t over-grazed and are able to regenerate. Goats are not intensively farmed. We pay artisans directly to ensure they receive reliable remuneration for their work, often double what they would get paid elsewhere

For more information on our products, Whatsapp on +91 8082926137

f) Gotsang Hike - A 40-minute drive from camp is the renowned Hemis monastery.

It takes a couple of hours to reach the trek starting point, driving along the Indus river.

Taxi between 3,000 and 5,000.
Guide – 3,000 to 3,500 but not always necessary. For an additional 1,000, the driver can act as a guide.

Motorbike Rental – Between 1,500 and 2,800 per day. Scootys, Enfield 350 to 500CC, Bajaj Avengers are available amongst others

9. Day Plans
   a) Leh in a Day - Explore the capital of Leh, its shops, restaurants and culture. There’s much to see and do in Leh, so have a word with us and we can give recommendations based on your preferences. Leh is just a 20-minute drive from the property.

Taxi between 1,500 and 3,000 rupees, depending on the waiting time for the taxi and where you go

Leh sits above our valley, encircled by mountains, with Leh Palace and Shanti Stupa towering above. Shanti Stupa is an excellent place to watch the sunset – as the colours of the valley change rapidly with the sunset cloud cover.

In the old town, there’s the Central Asian museum which offers context to Ladakh as a part of Central Asia, the Great Game and the Silk Route. If you like to shop, we can recommend trusted sellers of pashminas, antiques, gems as well as locally made cosmetic products and health foods (Organic Ladakh is best for these)For lunch, there's a restaurant, Namza, that does innovative takes on traditional Ladakhi food with fresh, local ingredients. De Khambir does more traditional food.
Ask at reception and we can give a printout of the map.

b) Indus Valley Tour - Ideal for your second day in Ladakh, explore the local monasteries of the Indus Valley, all within a short drive from the property, so that you can do it at leisure whilst still acclimatising.

Taxi between 1,800 and 3,500 rupees, depending on which monasteries and places you visit.
If you don’t mind an early start, there’s the option to head to Thiksey for morning prayers, which is the most stunning monastery in Ladakh. Monks play conch shell trumpets to announce the start of the prayers. If you go for prayers, you can return in time for breakfast. If not, you can visit Thiksey in the afternoon.

After breakfast at camp, we can take you on the walk through the village, to the Bactrian camel conservation centre – they aren’t indigenous to Ladakh, but were used along the Silk Route and managed to survive in the climate. From there, it’s a short drive to Matho, a monastery with the best views of our valley.

We can pack you a lunch or there are various options along the road. Stakna monastery is also a lovely place to pass by – its monastery is perched on a rock around which the Indus river bifurcates. It’s one of the most photogenic locations of Ladakh.

c) Sham Valley Tour - The Sham valley, a 1 hour drive from the camp, is centred around the Indus River, after the confluence with the Zanskar. an reach there within an hour. The region is dotted with beautiful hamlets of cultural significance and beautiful treks.

To Alchi and back, a taxi would cost around 3,500 to 4,500 rupees. If you were to travel into the Sham trekking area (Hemissukapachan ec), then that might cost around 5,000 to 6,000 rupees.
At 3,100 metres above sea level, Sham is a fertile valley, with two harvests in a year. It’s an ideal trekking location, yet there are roads throughout, so it can be explored in a day, overnight or with a multi-day hike.

En route to the Sham, you drive past the Sangam point, the confluence of the Indus and Zanskar rivers, where the colours of each river combine. Rafting is an option, but even driving along the Zanskar river rewards you with wonderful views. Close by is the Basgo fort, a beautiful location that was the location of a battle between the Mughals and Mongols in the 17th century. Few tourists visit there.

Further on is the village of Alchi, renowned for its set of 11th to 13th century murals. There’s also a great spot for lunch called Alchi Kitchen, a favourite for Ladakhi cuisine. If you’re interested in visiting more remote villages, there’s the stunning Mangyu, or the hidden village trek mentioned earlier.

Nimmu House and Namra Hotel are noteworthy options for accommodation for an overnight stay. Do ask us for more information, or for help in booking.

10. Further Afield Tours

a) Pangong Lake - The world’s highest saltwater lake, Pangong Tso, is a photographer’s dream – the lake’s colours transforming through the day, reflecting the surrounding mountain range. It’s a 3.5 hour drive each way.

Overnight taxi between 12,000 and 16,000 depending route and car. Day trip is 11,000 and 13,000. Renting an oxygen cylinder is recommended – they charge 2,500 for a 2-3 day rental

Accommodation varies in Pangong, but the higher end is around 13,000 per night

Pangong Lake stretches out for 140km from Ladakh into China. The colours of the lake and surrounding mountains change throughout the day.

It’s the most famous attraction in Ladakh, as it’s in the Bollywood film 3 Idiots. As a result, it can get quite touristy, which can affect the sense of peace
To reach Pangong, it takes 5 hours driving, some on poor quality roads. You have to cross the Chang La pass, which is 5,300 metres above sea level, so it’s best to go there on your 4th day or later, as Pangong itself is 4,300 metres above sea level and sleeping at altitude can be tricky.

You can either choose to visit as a 1-day trip, which is a 7-8 hours return drive, or you could stay the night there, but with the understanding that its very cold at night, most accommodation is not great, and sleeping at altitude can be tricky.. For most of the year, it’s possible to visit Pangong directly from Nubra Valley – it’s a 5-hour drive from Nubra to Pangong and another 3 to 4 hours back to Leh.

b)Nubra Valley - The Nubra Valley is a vast basin of sand dunes, river and greenery, encircled by the mountains of the Himalayan and Karakoram range. As well as the landscapes it offers, there are cultural attractions related to Buddhist and Balti culture.

An Innova to Nubra price varies by how many days, whether visiting Turtuk or Pangong. Price Range is between 18k and 35k. Ask us for more details.There are a wide range of properties – Lharimo North is decent and more affordable (5-7k). Kyagar is a better high end property.

Nubra has an important history within Central Asia and was part of the Silk Route and Great Game. Turtuk, a border village, is part of Baltistan, yet part of Ladakh. The village was in Pakistan until 1974, when it became a part of India, creating a regional partition. The village sits on a plateau above the river. A waterfall’s flow is channelled into the village, with three harvests a year and amazing apricots.

It’s a 5-hour drive to Nubra, via the Khardung La pass (5,300 metres above sea level), You must be well acclimatised for this, so local law prevents you from 2 days of acclimatisation at the camp. Turtuk is another 3 hours drive on from Hunder.

When you descend into Nubra, it forks into two valleys - one with Hunder and stretching to Turtuk and the other side, to the village of Sumur, the beautiful Yarab Tso Lake and the fascinating Ensa monastery. We recommend staying in Sumur, as its more peaceful, even if its further away from Turtuk.

It’s possible to return from Nubra via Pangong and make it a circular trip.

c) Tso Moriri - The Tso Moriri lake is as beautiful as Pangong, but with the additional interest of being in the nomadic region

The Changtang region, home to the nomads that shepherd Pashmina goats and Yaks,. Tso Kar, black necked cranes and other wildlife

An Innova Crysta to Tso Moriri overnight would cost around 20k, whilst a regular Innova would come to around 17k.

Hotel standards are low but cost 6,000Rs for two people with breakfast and dinner. It’s possible to take a wildlife guide with you, as there are more spottings in this direction. He would charge 4k per day

Tso Moriri is the second largest lake of Ladakh and is entirely within India. In addition to the magnificent lake, a trip to Tso Moriri takes you through the Changtang region on a circular route. There’s more wildlife in this region and there’s a nomadic community that shepherds yaks, sheep and pashmina goats.

To reach, it’s a 6-hour drive along the Indus, upstream in the direction of Tibet. On the return journey, we recommend the alternative route, ascending Taglang La pass of 5,300 metres. Along this route, you visit the drying up lakes of Tso Kar (pictured), with salt deposits and see Ladakh’s regional bird –black necked crane.
When visiting Tso Moriri, it’s necessary to stay the night, as the journey is too long and taxing for a one-day return. Accommodation is relatively basic – comfortable beds but the hot water is unlikely to work. If you are to visit, we recommend going after you have been in Ladakh for 4 days, so you are well acclimatised, as Tso Moriri is 4,500 metres above sea level. If you’re earlier in your trip, it’s good to take Diamox and it’s usually best to rent an oxygen cylinder in case of an emergency. An option is to stay at a homestay called Cho House and do a day trip to Tso Moriri from there

d) Hanle - Home to the Indian Astronomical Observatory, awarded Dark Sky Reserve status but also home to wildlife evolved to live in such difficult terrain, including the Pallas Cat – the rare, sweet and grumpiest wild cat

An Innova Crysta to Tso Moriri overnight would cost around 22k, whilst a regular Innova would come to around 19k. Both Tso Moriri and Hanle can also be visited as a 2 night trip

There are mostly guesthouses in Hanle, except a hotel - Hanle House, that charges around 8,000 rupees for 2 with breakfast and dinner. We recommend taking a wildlife guide to Hanle

In the nomadic Changtang region of Ladakh, close to the border with Tibet/China, lies the village of Hanle at 4,500 metres above sea level. Its remoteness and altitude inspired the Indian Astronomical Society to set up its observatory there

The entire Changtang region has very little light pollution and beautiful skies, but the night photography with the flat landscapes of Hanle and the observatory in the foreground make it particularly special for astrophotography. It was recently awarded Dark Sky Reserve status, so hopefully that will bring some level of conservation and minimisation of light pollution.
For those interested in wildlife, we recommend taking a guide with you. Arhaan, the previously mentioned birding guide, is a regular for trips to Changtang. Frequently spotted are Tibetan Wolves, Tibetan sand-foxes, Eurasian Owls, Himalayan Vultures and the Pallas Cats.

It is possible to visit Tso Moriri and Hanle in a circular trip, but be prepared for long journeys, high altitude and cold nights.

e) Himalayan Brown Bear Trip to Drenmo lodge near Drass - The rustic and well-appointed Drenmo Lodge by Drass hosts wildlife tours, with a particular focus on the Himalayan Brown Bear. Combine this with a trip to the Suru Valley, or on the way to Srinagar.

One night at the lodge costs 35,000 for 2 people with breakfast and dinner. A taxi return to Drass wih a 2-day wait is 20-23k. A one-way trip is 11-13k. A drop to Srinagar with a 2-day layover at Drass would be between 25 and 29 thousand

Witness the rare Himalayan Brown Bears in the second coldest inhabited place in the world. The Drenmo Lodge is arguably the best location in Western Ladakh for sighting these magnificent mammals in Ladakh. Along with Tibetan Wolf, Himalayan Red Fox, Long tail marmot, Asiatic Ibex, Ladakh Urial and even the elusive Snow Leopard. Drass is also a haven for birding as it is home to a variety of warblers, finches and raptors.

The lodge is run by Muzammil from Roots, a creator of experiences , different and interesting, in this part of the world and can colour your itinerary with his suggestions.

11. Longer Treks

a) Sham Valley Trek - The Sham Valley trek immerses you into the landscape and culture of one of the most unspoilt regions of Ladakh. Trekking here be difficult – most require 5-8 hours a day hiking in altitude, camping rough over multiple days.

Sham differs, as the trekking time is about 3-5 hours a day, with passes of 4,000 metres above sea level, instead of 5,000+. There are decent hotels and guesthouses along the route. And, crucially, there’s a road through the valley, not far from the trekking route, so if you are struggling, you can always call for a backup car. It also means that you can choose to do just 1 or 2 days of the 4-day trek It should be noted that hiking in altitude is hard work, especially over hilly terrain.

We recommend driving a couple of hours from the camp and doing the Hidden Village trek on the first day (mentioned earlier in the brochure). The excellent Namra hotel is close by. From there, you can hike one day to Hemissukapachan and the next to Ulley, home to the Snow Leopard lodge that operates wildlife tours in the winters, but is open in the summer, in a hamlet of 7 homes, high in the mountains.

On the way back to the camp, you could either trek to Likir (and take a pottery workshop) and drive back, or you could drive to the Sangam point and do rafting

b) Markha Valley Trek - The Markha Trek is a 5-day trek through the diverse scenery of the Hemis National
Park - rocky canyons and the vast expanse of Ladakhi scenery, dotted with tiny mountain hamlets, as the white peaks of Stok Kangri and Kang Yatse loom large.

It’s a challenging trek in the altitude – most days you will be trekking for 5 hours
but on one day you will need to hike for up to 8 hours. Twice, you will ascend
passes as high as 5,000 metres. At this altitude, you get clear views of the
neighbouring peaks and hills of Ladakh and Zanskar.

Accommodation would either be in homestays or camping - camping is the more
expensive option, given the horses that are necessary to carry the camps.
The villages along the route provide you a glimpse into life at its most remote. You
can expect to see Blue Sheep, Marmots, Yaks and even Ibex.

The trek is best embarked on after you have been in Ladakh for 3 or 4 days and are
better acclimatised.
